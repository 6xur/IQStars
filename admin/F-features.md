In addition to the features that are auto-graded, the graphical user interface
of our project implements the following features:

*(Remove those that are unimplemented)*

X A simple placement viewer (Task 5)
 
X A basic playable game in JavaFX (Task 8): When the game starts, its board will be checked if it is full or not. If not, players can place pieces outside of the board on valid locations. We have various methods to check the validity of the location to which a piece is placed. For example, is there any overlapping in pieces? Does it have the same color as the wizard it covers? 

X A basic playable game that snaps pieces to the board, allows rotation, and checks for validity (Tasks 6, 7, and 8): Once the player selects a level of difficulty, the board is filled with all pieces and/or wizards of the initial game state. On the side of the board are pieces that need to be placed. All pieces on the board and outside the board can be fully rotated, moved, and correctly colored. All pieces can be placed onto the board or taken out of the board with ease as the game proceeds and as long as the rules are followed.  

X Generates simple challenges (Task 9) 

X Solves the puzzle (Task 10): this task takes full use of many methods that check the validity of the game, the game string, the location to which a piece is placed, and the available cells recursively to deliver the solution to a game. 

X Implements hints (Task 11): A hint on where to place a piece can be initiated by hitting and holding the backslash key at any stage of the game. The hint is in the form of a blurry piece placed on the board. It disappears when the backslash key is released.


Additional features include:

X A drop-down menu on top of the game board for the player to choose the game's level of difficulty. There are five levels of difficulty, including starter, junior, expert, master, and wizard, all of which are correctly linked with the game challenges and solutions.

X Once the player selects a level of difficulty, the board is filled with all pieces and/or wizards of the initial game state. On the side of the board are pieces that need to be placed.
